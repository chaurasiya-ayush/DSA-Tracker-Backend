## 📈 Score Calculation

The score is calculated based on **completion percentage** of assigned problems:
- **Hard problems**: (hard_solved/hard_assigned) × 20 points
- **Medium problems**: (medium_solved/medium_assigned) × 15 points
- **Easy problems**: (easy_solved/easy_assigned) × 10 points

```
Total Score = (hard_solved/hard_assigned × 20) + 
              (medium_solved/medium_assigned × 15) + 
              (easy_solved/easy_assigned × 10)
```

### Example Calculation
If a student has:
- **Hard**: 8 solved out of 10 assigned → 8/10 × 20 = 16 points
- **Medium**: 12 solved out of 15 assigned → 12/15 × 15 = 12 points  
- **Easy**: 20 solved out of 20 assigned → 20/20 × 10 = 10 points
- **Total Score**: 16 + 12 + 10 = 38 points

### Time-Based Scoring
- **Weekly**: Score calculated from completion percentage of problems solved this week only
- **Monthly**: Score calculated from completion percentage of problems solved this month only
- **All-time**: Score calculated from completion percentage of all problems ever solved

### Fair Ranking System
The completion-based scoring ensures:
- **Fair comparison**: Students with similar completion ratios get similar scores
- **Difficulty weighting**: Hard problems have higher weight (20pts) than medium (15pts) and easy (10pts)
- **Assignment context**: Score reflects performance relative to assigned problems, not just raw counts

---

## 🎯 Completion Percentage Calculation

Completion percentages are calculated as:
```
Completion % = (solved_count / assigned_count) × 100
```

**Fallback Logic**: If no questions are assigned to a student's batch, the system uses the total available questions in the database as the denominator.

---

## 📋 Ranking Logic

### Global Ranking
Students are ranked globally by:
1. Score (descending)
2. Hard completion (descending)
3. Medium completion (descending)
4. Easy completion (descending)
5. Max streak (descending)
6. Total solved (descending)

### City Ranking
Students are ranked within their city using the same criteria as global ranking.

## 📊 Database Schema

### Key Tables Used
- **Student**: Student information
- **Batch**: Batch details (year, city_id)
- **City**: City information
- **StudentProgress**: Problem-solving records
- **Question**: Problem details (difficulty level)
- **Leaderboard**: Pre-calculated statistics

### Joins Used
```sql
Student s
JOIN Batch b ON b.id = s.batch_id
JOIN City c ON c.id = s.city_id
JOIN Leaderboard l ON l.student_id = s.id
LEFT JOIN student_solves ss ON ss.student_id = s.id
```

---

## 🚀 Performance Considerations

- **Limit**: Results are limited to top 100 students
- **Indexes**: Ensure indexes on `student_id`, `batch_id`, `city_id`, `solved_at`
- **Caching**: Consider caching frequently accessed leaderboards
- **Real-time**: Scores are calculated in real-time for accuracy

---

## 📝 Notes

- The API automatically falls back to all-time data if no data exists for the specified year
- City and year names are case-sensitive
- The API respects batch year filtering, not the year when problems were solved
- All timestamps are in UTC
- Rankings are recalculated on each request for accuracy
